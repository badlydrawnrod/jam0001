This is a sample .comment program. This line, ironically, is ignored because it is not a comment.

/**

 * @param the phrase
 * @param total number of repetitions

// Set repetitions so far to 0.
// If total number of repetitions is 0 then jump forward 4 lines.
// Print with the string as the phrase.
// Set repetitions so far to repetitions so far + 1.
// Jump back 2 lines.
// And we're done.

The main program is below!
