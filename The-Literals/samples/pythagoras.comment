This is a sample .comment program. This line, ironically, is ignored because it is not a comment.

/**
 * Calculates the square of a hypotenuse.
 *
 * @param a
 * @param b
 * @returns c squared
 */
// Set a squared to a * a.
// Set b squared to b * b.
// Set c squared to a squared + b squared.

The main program is below!

// Calculate the square of a hypotenuse with a as 3 and b as 4.
// Print it.
// Print "But [c squared] is the square of the hypotenuse, and not the hypotenuse itself.".
